May 2013: Learn Ray Tracing with POV-Ray
========================================
Four years ago, I wrote in Java to render a scene hard-coded in the
source code. The source code and the rendered scene from the Java ray
tracer is available at [mycask/java-ray-tracing][JRT].

After writing this ray tracer, I came to know about sophisticated ray
tracing engines available for free on the internet. POV-Ray seemed to be
one of the most popular engines and I decided to learn to use it.
However, I never managed to devote time to learning it in the last four
years. Finally, in May 2013, I decided to teach myself to do ray tracing
with POV-Ray. This activity consisted of learning the concepts required
to write scene descriptions for POV-Ray, and writing a new scene each
day for 25 days in the month of May 2013.

The source code and the rendered scenes are available at
[mycask/pov-ray-tracing][PRT].

Progress log

The list below shows how much time I spent each day learning new
concepts, coding and tinkering to generate each scene. The values
displayed below doesn't include the time spent by the computer in
rendering the images.

July 2013: Write QuickQWERTY 1.0.0
==================================
Five years ago, I wrote a typing tutor called QuickQWERTY. The first
release, version 0.0.5, was made on 22 November 2008. The last release,
version 0.4, was made on 23 May 2010. No release has been made since
then. These releases are hosted on SourceForge at the following URL:
<http://sourceforge.net/projects/quickqwerty/files/QuickQWERTY/>.

QuickQWERTY 0.4, the last stable release, has a badly written page
layout. The page layout has been designed using HTML table elements. In
July 2013, I decided to rewrite the typing tutor from scratch with the
page layout done properly using HTML div elements and styling them with
CSS, host the code on GitHub at <https://github.com/susam/quickqwerty>,
and make the tutor available for usage at <http://quickqwerty.com/>.

Conclusion
----------
I began this project on 1 July 2013 and completed it on 25 August 2013.
This activity took about 1 hour 37 minutes per day on average. This 25
day challenge ended with two development releases. 

In future, I'll continue to develop QuickQWERTY further and make stable
releases of this software.
